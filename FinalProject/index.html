                I'm a Mexican CS freshman student who is currently learning front  end web development. I have been taking programming courses since High School and have experience mainly in problem solving with compiled languages. I am currently working on expanding my knowledge on many fields of Computer Science with the goal of becoming a Software Developer by pursuing my degree, taking additional courses, and looking for an internship that can provide me with proessional experience.
