        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p>I graduated from my High School being among the top 15 students in my generation, I was in the top 10% global percentile in the final International Baccalaurate score by scoring 42 points. I took IB Computer Science class and my final project consisted in creating a system with Java and JavaFX to plan for school activities and passing the planning directly to an Excel.</p>
        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>At College I have taken numerical methods for both differentiation and integration applied to engineering by simulating projectile motion with air friction and the length of a non-linear function that represents a racing track. My programming knowledge from college covers simulations in MATLAB, Python, and object oriented programming in C++.</p>
        <h2>Additional Courses</h2>
        <p>From additional courses in diverse platforms I've learned Object Oriented Programming in Python, Python integration with SQL, SQL basics, HTML5, CSS3, React basics, and Google Cloud Fundamentals.</p>
